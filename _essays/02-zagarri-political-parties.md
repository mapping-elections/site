The Mapping Early American Elections (MEAE) website is an invaluable
resource for visualizing the development of party politics in the early
United States. This information, however, must be interpreted within the
context of the times. Political parties during the early national era
were fundamentally different from political parties today, and even
significantly from the parties that developed later in the nineteenth
century.

The framers of the US Constitution had not anticipated the development
of permanent political parties. Parties were considered factions,
dangerous and illegitimate alliances that pursued their own
self-interest at the expense of the common good. National leaders were
expected to serve the interests of the entire nation, not to cater to
any particular regional, class, or state interests. This ideal of
governance was first challenged during the debate over the ratification
of the Constitution. Opponents of the Constitution, called
"Anti-Federalists," challenged supporters of the Constitution, called
"Federalists," for votes. Despite the intensity of the conflict, these
coalitions were transient and disappeared soon after the new government
went into operation.

During the first years of the new republic's existence, two distinct and
mutually antagonistic coalitions quickly emerged, coalescing into the
first nascent political parties. Historians have come to call these two
groups the "Federalists" and the "Democratic-Republicans." (Note that
despite having the same name, the Federalists of the 1790s represented a
very different coalition from the Federalists of the ratification
period. Similarly, although "Democratic-Republicans" during this era
were sometimes simply called "Republicans," the two parties are not
related.) This was a period of great experimentation and change in the
development of political parties. In general, Federalists and
Democratic-Republicans espoused competing, and often contradictory,
visions of the nation's future. Federalists, for example, tended to
favor a strong central government, a capitalist financial system, and a
pro-British foreign policy. In contrast, Democratic-Republicans insisted
on the primacy of state governments, an agrarian economy dominated by
small farmers (and, in the South, slaveowners), and a pro-French foreign
policy. Each side also advocated contrasting visions of society. While
the Federalists emphasized the traditional values of hierarchy,
stability, and order, the Democratic-Republicans promoted a more
egalitarian vision that encouraged an expansion of political
realm---albeit only for white males and at the exclusion of white women
and African Americans.

In very general terms, during the period before the War of 1812,
Federalists tended to dominate in the New England states and
Democratic-Republicans were increasingly prominent in the Mid-Atlantic,
Southern, and new western states. In Congress, representatives quickly
began to identify with one group or the other; by 1793, they began
voting as two distinctive blocs. Outside Congress, both parties soon
became skilled at mobilizing popular support for their candidates and
policies. They founded partisan newspapers, held political parades and
public celebrations, and designed new kinds of electioneering techniques
to bring out the vote at election time.

Yet these early political parties lacked many of the features of modern
political parties. Neither the Federalists nor the
Democratic-Republicans had a highly centralized political organization,
elaborate election procedures, or a uniform national ideology. State or
local issues, rather than national issues, often provided the basis for
party affiliation and identification. Most importantly, neither side
recognized the other as legitimate. Each party insisted that only its
views reflected the true legacy of the American Revolution. Their goal
was not to seek compromise with the other party but pursue its
extinction.

Maps from the MEAE website help tell the stories of these early
political parties. In the early congresses, for example, it was not
uncommon for party allegiances to shift rapidly and frequently. Between
1798 and 1806, Federalists virtually disappeared in North Carolina---and
then staged something of a comeback during the War of 1812 (figure 1). The
names of the parties often changed over time or varied from
state-to-state. In Maryland, for example, congressional elections for
the First Congress revisited the debate over the Constitution and pitted
the Federalists against the Anti-Federalists. In 1790, however,
candidates from the so-called "Potomac" party challenged those from the
"Chesapeake" party in a [match]](http://earlyamericanelections.org/maps/meae.congressional.congress02.md.county.html) that highlighted local rather than national divisions and interests.

![Figure 1. The top map, showing North Carolina’s election for the [Tenth Congress](http://earlyamericanelections.org/maps/meae.congressional.congress10.nc.county.html), demonstrates the virtual disappearance of the Federalists (green) in the state between 1798 and 1806. In this election, the Federalists received a majority of the vote in only one district. However, during the War of 1812, the Federalists staged somewhat of a comeback. In North Carolina’s election for the [Fourteenth Congress](http://earlyamericanelections.org/maps/meae.congressional.congress14.nc.county.html), shown in the the bottom map, more than one quarter of the elected representatives were Federalists.](/content-img/nc10-14-maps.png)

Splinter factions also emerged, mostly among the Democratic-Republicans,
that divided the party and created new kinds of alliances. For
simplicity's sake, the MEAE project has identified these splinter
factions, from whatever period or state, under the general heading of
"Republican Faction." For example, a dissident Democratic-Republican
group called the "Tertium Quids" combined disaffected Republicans with
like-minded Federalists. These partisans were especially active in New
York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and Ohio from 1804 to 1808 (figure 2),
before they were re-absorbed into the Democratic-Republican party.
New York was in a category of its own, nurturing a huge array of
splinter groups. As John Brooke explains in his essay, New York included
factions such as the Bucktails, Clintonians, Lewisites, Opposition
Republicans, and the aptly named Division versus Anti-Division factions (figure 3). Such
party designations had local significance but not national recognition.
Nonetheless, elected members from these groups usually voted with the
Democratic-Republicans in Congress.

![Figure 2. These four maps demonstrate the varied support in several states for the "Tertium Quids” (orange), a Democratic-Republican faction which combined disaffected Republicans with like-minded Federalists. Two Quid candidates were elected for the [Ninth Congress in Virginia](http://earlyamericanelections.org/maps/meae.congressional.congress09.va.county.html) and for the [Tenth Congress in Pennsylvania](http://earlyamericanelections.org/maps/meae.congressional.congress10.pa.county.html). In Ohio’s election for the [Eleventh Congress](http://earlyamericanelections.org/maps/meae.congressional.congress11.oh.county.html) Quid Jeremiah Morrow won the state’s only seat with 71.5% of the vote. In Maryland’s election for the [Tenth Congress](http://earlyamericanelections.org/maps/meae.congressional.congress10.md.county.html) Quid candidates received votes in five out of eight districts, but none were elected to Congress.](/content-img/quids-map.png)

![Figure 3. After becoming the dominant political force in New York in the early 1800s, the Democratic-Republicans (purple) splintered into several competing factions (orange), each centered around a strong leader, and sustained by fierce party loyalty and patronage.

Beginning with the Election of 1800, the Federalists went into a long
period of decline. Although they remained competitive in many state and
local elections, they lost the ability to win the presidency or control
Congress. Nonetheless, the Federalists experienced an impressive
resurgence during the Embargo of 1807--1808 as well as the War of 1812.
In these periods, Federalist candidates contested many state-level
elections and recaptured a number of seats in Congress (figure 4). These
developments occurred not only in Federalist-leaning states in New
England, such Massachusetts and New Hampshire, but also in Pennsylvania
and Maryland. Even South Carolina saw a brief resurgence of Federalist
victories.

![Figure 4. After 1800, the Federalist’s influence slowly declined. While they were able to contest local elections, they were no longer able to win the presidency or control Congress. However, as these map show, the Federalist Party (green) experienced a resurgence across the country during the War of 1812. During elections for the Fourteenth Congress, Federalist-leaning states in the north such as [New Hampshire](http://earlyamericanelections.org/maps/meae.congressional.congress14.nh.county.html) elected all Federalist representatives. Federalists also won seats in the Mid-Atlantic in states such as [Maryland](http://earlyamericanelections.org/maps/meae.congressional.congress14.md.county.html) (5 out of 9 seats) and [Pennsylvania](http://earlyamericanelections.org/maps/meae.congressional.congress14.pa.county.html) (7 out of 23 seats). Even voters in [South Carolina](http://earlyamericanelections.org/maps/meae.congressional.congress14.sc.county.html) elected one Federalist to Congress.](/content-img/federalist-resurgence.png)

Yet the Federalist victories did not continue. By 1820, the First Party
System, featuring the Federalists and Democratic-Republicans, had
collapsed. A plethora of new parties began to emerge. In the critical
election of 1824, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, and
William H. Crawford all ran for president, each claiming to represent a
different constituency within the Democratic-Republican party. Also in
1824, certain candidates for Congress revealed their political views by
associating themselves with (or opposing) one of the presidential
contenders. In Kentucky, for example, candidates aligned themselves with
either the Jacksonian, Adams/Clay, or traditional Democratic-Republican
wings of the party (figure 5). These developments set the stage for the subsequent emergence of the so-called
"Second Party System"---a new configuration which pit Andrew Jackson's
Democratic Party against Henry Clay's Whigs during the 1830s.

![Figure 5. After 1820, the Democratic-Republicans splintered into several groups, each supporting a different presidential hopeful. During Kentucky’s election for the [Nineteenth Congress](http://earlyamericanelections.org/maps/meae.congressional.congress19.ky.county.html), voters supported the traditional Democratic-Republican party (purple), a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay (red), or a faction led by Andrew Jackson (blue). The Adams/Clay faction won seven seats, while the Jackson faction won five seats.](/content-img/ky19-map.png)

Convoluted though these developments may be, tracking electoral shifts
in early American political parties reveals larger changes in popular
political allegiances, partisan ideologies, and sectional tensions.
Though limited to white males, these changes demonstrate the growth of
what historian Andrew Robertson has called "the tortuous trajectory of
American democracy." Yet it is critical to understand these changes in
the same terms that people living in the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries understood them. Parties at this time were evolving
institutions whose legitimacy and structure were not well-defined---yet
which, at the same time, came to occupy a crucial, and unexpected, role
in the American political process. Political parties acted as one of the
most significant vehicles for linking Americans in their local
communities with their far-off and distant federal government. Neither
anticipated nor initially welcomed, political parties quickly proved to
be an essential feature of American political life.
