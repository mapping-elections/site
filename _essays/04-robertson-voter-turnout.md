abstract: While previous studies have reported fairly low levels of voter participation during the early national era, voter turnout actually increased dramatically during this period, with 50 to 70 percent of the total free male population frequently voting in many states. In contrast with later political systems, substantive issues, rather than party loyalty, galvanized voters during the First Party System and propelled them to the polls.

When did the United States become a democracy? One of the best measures
of democracy---of democratic practice in politics---is the number and
proportion of eligible voters who cast ballots in a given election.
Changes in turnout---an increase or decrease in voter
participation---also provides a good indicator of the voters' degree of
engagement with their representative government. Due to the lack of
comprehensive voter returns for the period before 1825, it has been
difficult for historians to determine with accuracy the levels of voter
turnout in the decades immediately following the ratification of the US
Constitution. The Mapping Early American Elections (MEAE) project
contains the data that makes it possible to depict visualizations of
turnout. This essay will provide examples of maps of turnout from a few
specific elections

Contrary to the prevailing myth, a large proportion of the white male
population in colonial British North America was actually eligible to
vote, even before the American Revolution. Despite the existence of
property qualifications for voting in all the colonies, the widespread
availability of land meant that most white males could own enough land
to meet the franchise requirements. The American Revolution accelerated
the trend toward universal male suffrage by lowering or removing
property qualifications for voting. In addition, some states
enfranchised free black men. In one state, New Jersey, single women who
owned property (i.e. widows and spinsters) could vote from 1776 until
1807.

Possessing the ability to vote, however, is different from actually
exercising the franchise. Studies have shown that in the colonial era,
levels of voter participation tended to remain fairly low. Turnout
tended to increase only in elections where major issues were at stake or
the candidates presented sharply different political alternatives. In
general, however, voters tended to defer to the elite members of society
in matters of governance.

The MEAE project presents visual evidence that challenges the
conventional narrative of early American history: that "democratic"
elections only really began with the election of Andrew Jackson in 1828.
Until the emergence of the so-called "Second Party System," it has been
said that voter participation levels remained relatively low. Evidence
from the New Nation Votes project suggests otherwise. Voter turnout
actually increased dramatically during the era of the First Party
System. In fact, the highest turnout levels in the age of Federalists
and Democratic Republicans often equaled or even exceeded Jacksonian
voter participation. A quarter century before Jackson's election, voter
turnout frequently reached 50 to 70 percent of the total free male
population in many states. In those states which explicitly restricted
the votes to whites, turnout is measured as the total vote divided by
the total number of white adult male inhabitants.

In the late 1790s, a variety of factors sharply boosted voter turnout.
Both the Federalists and the Democratic Republicans vigorously contested
elections from the late 1790s until after the War of 1812. A burgeoning
network of partisan newspapers helped to frame the news for readers who
strongly identified with their political party. Finally, substantive
issues galvanized voters, propelling them to the polls.

Turnout surged in states which had a competitive party environment,
including New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts (including Maine),
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and North Carolina. Each party had an
interest in mobilizing every single voter and getting him (or in New
Jersey, him and her) to the polls. In the late 1790s, the Democratic
Republicans created a more democratic form of political rhetoric and new
techniques of voter mobilization. In the years after 1800 the Federalist
party likewise refashioned itself with a more popular style of rhetoric
and new mobilization practices.

As party newspapers spread, editors put issues in a partisan framework,
thus reinforcing electors' party identification and their motivation to
vote. In states which had intense party competition and a network of
party newspapers, turnout in many congressional races rose above 50
percent of the adult free male population.

In the age of Jefferson and Madison, critical issues also helped drive
voters to the polls. The greatest surge in turnout occurred after the
passage of the Embargo Act in 1807. Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic
Republicans advocated American withdrawal from foreign trade until the
British and/or French respected American neutral rights. As the Embargo
distressed the commercial centers of New England and the Middle
Atlantic, the Federalists enjoyed a dramatic revival.

After 1808, turnout surged in the five northeastern states that had
near-universal male suffrage and competitive parties---New Hampshire,
Vermont, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Delaware. Turnout increased to
seventy percent in both Pennsylvania and New Hampshire in gubernatorial
elections. In the western states of Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky,
Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, gubernatorial turnout sometimes
exceeded seventy percent of adult white male inhabitants even though these
states lacked two-party competition.

After 1808, many congressional races exhibited a sharp rise in turnout.
Maryland, for example, had very competitive and closely balanced
parties. Maryland also had an extensive network of important Republican
and Federalist newspapers, more than any other southern state. Moreover,
Baltimore and Philadelphia party newspapers had wide circulation in
adjacent areas of Maryland. The Embargo and the War of 1812 were also
important issues in Maryland. All of these contributed to the increased
voter turnout in that state. (See the accompanying maps in figure 1 for
turnout in 1800, 1810, and 1820. These were census years that provide
accurate counts of the adult male population. For more specific results
using the New Nation Votes data, see the table in figure 2 which shows
the turnout in Maryland congressional elections in 1808, 1810 and 1812.)

In the congressional elections of 1808, all nineteen counties in
Maryland registered turnout of fifty percent or more of all adult white
male inhabitants. (Maryland, which originally allowed free men of color
to vote on the same basis as whites, eliminated free black suffrage in
1801.) Only Baltimore Town registered less than fifty percent turnout. In
1810, however, no compelling issues came before the electorate. Only
three congressional districts (five counties and Baltimore Town) had
contested congressional elections and turnout plummeted. In 1812, the
two parties fielded opposing candidates in six of the eight
congressional districts. Fifteen of the nineteen counties had turnout
over fifty percent.

Using MEAE maps and tables of congressional turnout, we can see a
critically important difference between the first party system of
Federalists and Democratic Republicans and the later Jacksonian parties.
Issues played a critical role in driving voters to the polls in the
first party system. When critical issues came before the Maryland
voters, as in 1808 and 1812, turnout was very high. On the other hand,
when election issues were less compelling as in 1810, fewer elections
were contested, parties were less competitive, and fewer voters turned
out to the polls. The first party system was unique in that its voters
seem to have been driven more by issues than by loyalty to a party
organization.

By analyzing voter turnout from 1788 to 1824 we can learn a great deal
about the extent of democratic practice in those years. We can see that
the democratic revolution in voting began in the late 1790s and
continued until 1817. After 1808, only five states still had
consistently low turnout, thanks to remaining property restrictions. But
even as voting was expanding for unpropertied white men, it was
contracting for free men of color. New Jersey had allowed woman suffrage
for thirty-one years but even as it allowed unpropertied white men to
vote in 1807, the state eliminated votes for women. In the Jacksonian
era, suffrage laws further narrowed the rights of free black men to
vote. Thus in the early American republic even as democracy expanded for
some, it continued to exclude others. Democracy was a promise as well as
a process---one whose promise had not yet been fully realized.
