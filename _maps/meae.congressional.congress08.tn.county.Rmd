Tennessee elected three Democratic-Republicans to the Eighth Congress.

Mapping this election is incomplete because of the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Tennessee used a statewide at-large method for electing members to Congress. Tennessee was apportioned two more seats in the House of Representatives.
