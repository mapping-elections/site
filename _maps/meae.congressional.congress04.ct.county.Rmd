Connecticut elected seven Federalists to the Fourth Congress, five of whom were incumbents. 

Mapping this election is not possible because there are insufficient returns at the town and county levels. 

Connecticut used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress. 

In May 1795, Nathaniel Smith was elected in a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ct.special.congress.1795) to fill the seat vacated by Jonathan Trumbull after he was elected to the U.S. Senate.
