South Carolina elected three Federalists and three Democratic-Republicans to the Fifth Congress.

Mapping this election is incomplete because of the lack of local returns in many areas. 

South Carolina used the district system for electing members to Congress. 

In September 1797, South Carolina held a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:sc.uscongress.specialelection.1797) in which Thomas Pickney was elected to replace William L. Smith, who resigned when he was appointed minister to Portugal.
