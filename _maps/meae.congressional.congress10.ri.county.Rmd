Rhode Island elected two Democratic-Republicans to the Tenth Congress.

Rhode Island used a statewide at-large method for electing a member to Congress.

In 1808, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ri.uscongress.special.1808) was held in which Federalist Richard Jackson, Jr. was elected to replace Nehemiah Knight, who died while in office.
