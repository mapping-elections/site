Pennsylvania voters elected seven Democratic-Republicans, five Federalists, and one unaffiliated candidate to the Third Congress.

Pennsylvania returned to a state-wide at-large system for electing members to Congress. Following the 1790 Census, Pennsylvania gained five seats in the House of Representatives.
