Connecticut elected five Federalists to the second Congress. 

Mapping this election is not possible because there are insufficient returns at the town and county levels.

Connecticut used a state-wide at-large system for electing members to Congress.

Among those elected, Pierpont Edwards declined to serve and was replaced by Jeremiah Wadsworth in a [special election](http://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ct.special.congress.1790).
