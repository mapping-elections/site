North Carolina elected ten Democratic-Republicans to the Fifth Congress.

North Carolina used the district system for electing members to Congress.

In August 1798, North Carolina held a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:nc.uscongress10.special.1798) in which Nathan Bryan was elected to replace Richard Spraight, who died while in office.
