Massachusetts elected eight Federalists and six representatives that were not officially affiliated with a political party to the Fourth Congress.  

Although Massachusetts used the district system for electing members to Congress, state law required that candidates receive a majority of votes in order to win. As a result, four districts required multiple ballots to elect their members in elections November 1794 through April 1795:
