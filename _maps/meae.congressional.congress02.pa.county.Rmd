Pennsylvania sent six Federalists and two Democratic-Republicans to the Second Congress.

For this election Pennsylvania changed from a state-wide at-large system to a district system for electing members to Congress. 

Votes tallied for the city of Philadelphia are shown separately, and they are in addition to the votes reported for Philadelphia County.
