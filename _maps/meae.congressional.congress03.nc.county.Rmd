North Carolina's voters elected seven Republicans and three Federalists to the Third Congress.

Many of the electoral returns at the county and district levels are incomplete.

North Carolina used a district system for electing members to Congress. After the 1790 Census, North Carolina gained five seats in the House of Representatives.
