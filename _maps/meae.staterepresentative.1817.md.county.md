:::

In 1817, Maryland elected eighty representatives to the state's House of
Delegates. At least nine of them were Federalists, and at least twenty
of them were Democratic-Republicans.

The map for this election is incomplete due to the lack of returns at
the county level.

Members of Maryland's House of Delegates were chosen through popular
elections. Each of Maryland's nineteen counties elected four members
using a county-level at-large method. Annapolis and the City of
Baltimore each elected two members.

Maryland had three legislative bodies: The House of Delegates, which was
elected annually in October and had eighty members; a State Senate,
comprised of fifteen members, chosen every five years in early
September; and a Governor's Council made up of five members chosen
yearly by the Legislature.
