After initial returns were counted, Delaware elected John Patten, an Anti-Federalist, to Congress. But the U.S. House of Representatives threw out some irregular votes and seated Henry Lattimer, a Federalist. This map depicts the initial count of votes.

Delaware’s election law required that voters select two candidates, with one residing in the voter’s own county, and the other residing in one of the state's other two counties. The at-large winner was then declared the winner.
