New Hampshire elected four Federalists and one unaffiliated candidate to the First Congress. 

Mapping this election is not possible because there are insufficient returns at the town and county levels.

New Hampshire used a state-wide at-large system to elect members of Congress. These candidate were elected on the second ballot. Benjamin West declined his election and was replaced by Abiel Foster in a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:nh.uscongress.special.1789).
