Connecticut elected seven Federalists to the Fifth Congress.

Mapping this election is not possible because of the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Connecticut used a statewide at-large method for electing members to Congress.

In October 1797, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ct.special.congress.1797) was held in which William Edmond was elected to replace James Davenport, who died while in office.
