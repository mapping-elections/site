South Carolina elected two Federalists and four members unaffiliated with a particular party to the Fourth Congress.

Mapping this election is not possible because of lack of local election returns.

In January 1795, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:sc.uscongress.specialelection.1795) was held in which Wade Hampton was elected to replace John Barnwell, who had been elected but declined to serve.
