:::

In 1806, Pennsylvania elected at least fourteen Federalists, forty
Democratic-Republicans, and twenty-five Republicans who were part of a
faction within the party to Pennsylvania's House of Representatives. In
this election, the Republican faction was a coalition of Federalists and
moderate Democratic-Republicans (Constitutionalists). This group of
candidates was often referred to as Quids. Democratic-Republicans and
Quids clashed over impeachments, the governor's appointment powers, and
reforms of the constitution and the court system.

While Pennsylvania's state legislature started out as a unicameral
assembly, in 1791, the Pennsylvania General Assembly became a bicameral
legislature, with a House of Representatives whose members were elected
annually in October and a state Senate whose members were elected to
four-year terms.

Pennsylvania used a district system for electing members to Pennsylvania
House of Representatives. Districts elected various numbers of
Representatives (based on population), and were normally made up of a
single county. However, during the early 1800s, numerous new counties
were organized, especially in the sparsely settled western and northern
part of the state. These new counties, for periods of time, voted with
their parent county, and returns were rarely reported for them
individually. This resulted in several multiple-county districts.

In this election the following counties voted together in a single
district: Allegheny, Beaver, and Butler Counties. Armstrong, Indiana,
Jefferson and Westmoreland Counties voted together. Crawford, Erie,
Mercer, Venango, and Warren Counties voted together. The votes cast in
Warren County are included in the Venango County totals. Centre and
Clearfield Counties voted together. Lycoming, Tioga, and Potter Counties
voted together. Northampton and Wayne Counties voted together. The votes
cast in Cambria County are included in the Somerset County totals.

In October 1806, elections where held simultaneously for Pennsylvania's
House of Representatives and for Pennsylvania's delegation to the [Tenth
U.S.
Congress](https://earlyamericanelections.org/maps/meae.congressional.congress10.pa.county.html).
Federalist, Democratic-Republican, and Quid candidates were elected in
both contests.
