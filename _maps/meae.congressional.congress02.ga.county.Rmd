Georgia elected two anti-Federalists and one Federalist to the Second Congress. 

Georgia used a state-wide at-large system for electing members to Congress, but candidates had to be resident in the district to which they were elected.

The election between Anthony Wayne and James Jackson in the first district was contested, and the results from Effingham and Camden counties were ruled invalid. A [special election](http://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ga.uscongress.special.1792) was held in July, 1792, in which Republican John Millage defeated the Federalist Matthew McAllister.
