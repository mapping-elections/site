Maryland elected six Federalists to the First Congress. The Federalists swept the election with a large margin of victory.

Maryland used a state-wide at-large system to elect members of Congress. Candidates had to be residents of a specific Congressional district. 

Votes tallied for the cities of Baltimore and Annapolis are shown separately, and they are in addition to the votes reported for Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County.
