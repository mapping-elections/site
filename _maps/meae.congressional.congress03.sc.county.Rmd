South Carolina elected one Federalist, four Anti-Federalists, and one candidate transitioning between parties to the Third Congress. John Hunter was a Federalist elector for president in 1792, but in 1796 he was elected a Democratic-Republican to the U.S. Senate.

Many of the parish and district returns for the Third Congress are incomplete for South Carolina.

South Carolina used a district system for electing members to Congress. Following the 1790 Census, South Carolina gained a seat in the House of Representatives. After Alexander Gillon died, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:sc.uscongress.district2.1794) was held in which Robert G. Harper was elected to replace him.
