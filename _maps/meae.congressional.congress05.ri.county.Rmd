Rhode Island elected two Federalists to the Fifth Congress. 

Rhode Island used a statewide at-large method for electing members to Congress, though each of the two representatives were elected on separate tickets. 

Benjamin Bourne would resign before taking his seat in Congress and a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ri.uscongress.specialelection.1796) would elect Elisha R. Potter to fill his seat.

In 1797, Rhode Island held a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ri.uscongress1.1797) in which Thomas Tillinghast replaced Elisha R. Potter, who resigned his seat.
