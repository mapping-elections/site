Missouri elected one Democratic-Republican to the Eighteenth Congress. The Democratic-Republican was part of a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay.

Mapping this election is not possible because of the lack of returns at the town or county level.

Missouri used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress.
