Tennessee elected one representative to the Fifth Congress.

Mapping this election is incomplete because of the lack of returns at the town or county level in many areas. 

Tennessee re-elected Andrew Jackson to serve in the Fifth Congress. In September 1797, Jackson resigned from the House of Representatives in order to accept a seat in the US Senate. Tennessee held a special election which elected William Charles Cole Claiborne, which is the election presented here.
