Connecticut elected seven Federalists to the Third Congress. 

Mapping this election is not possible because there are insufficient returns at the town and county levels.

Connecticut used a state-wide at-large system for electing members to Congress.

Several of Connecticutâ€™s Congressmen were replaced in two different special elections in [May](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ct.special.congress.1793) and [December](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ct.special2.congress.1793) 1793.
