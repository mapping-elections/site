Delaware elected one Democratic-Republican member to the Fourth
Congress.

Delaware used a statewide at-large method for electing members to
Congress. Delaware's election law required that voters select two
candidates, with one residing in the voter's own county, and the other
residing in one of the state's other two counties. The at-large winner
was then declared the winner. This map depicts the runoff between the
initial winners.
