Rhode Island elected two Federalists to the Third Congress.

Mapping this election is not possible because there are insufficient returns at the town and county levels.

Rhode Island used a state-wide at-large system for electing members to Congress. After the 1790 Census, Rhode Island gained a seat in the House of Representatives.
