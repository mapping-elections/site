Indiana elected three Democratic-Republicans to the Nineteenth Congress. Two of those Democratic-Republicans were part of a faction led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay, and the other Democratic-Republican was part of a faction led by Andrew Jackson.

Indiana used a district system for electing members to Congress.
