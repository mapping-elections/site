New Hampshire elected two Federalists and two members not officially affiliated with a party to the Fourth Congress.

Mapping this election is not possible because of insufficient returns at the town or county level.

Although New Hampshire used a statewide at-large method for electing members to Congress, state law required that candidates receive a majority of votes in order to win. In a second runoff election, Abiel Foster beat the incumbent Paine Wingate.
