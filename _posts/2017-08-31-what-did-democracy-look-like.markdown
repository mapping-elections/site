Early American elections subvert conventional notions that portray the
development of early American democracy as an orderly or systematic
affair. In contrast to the well-organized procedures governing voting
procedures today, elections during the first few decades of the new
nation's existence were often haphazard affairs. Everything from the
location of the polls to the qualifications of the electors to the
number of days the polls would be open varied from state to state, and
often, from election to election. Sometimes going to polls could be
injurious to one's health, since they were occasionally the scene of
riots. Democracy, then, evolved less by design and more from a constant
push-and-pull between those seeking to cast their ballots and those who
made the rules about when, where, and how the ballots were to be cast.

Article I, Section 4 of the US Constitution gave state legislatures the
power to determine "the Times, Places and Manner" of federal elections,
along with the power they already possessed to determine rules for state
elections. Suffrage requirement for the lower houses of their
legislatures also determined requirements for the federal franchise. As
a result, the variation in election rules and procedures makes the task
of generalization very difficult---and made the process of running the
newly established federal government even more challenging.

There was, for example, no uniformly established day on which to hold
elections. In New England and New York, for example, elections tended to
occur in the spring for legislative gatherings that would convene later
in the year. In the Mid-Atlantic states and Upper South elections were
often held in the late summer or the early fall. South Carolina and
Georgia preferred late fall elections, although they were soon moved to
October to accommodate Congress's schedule.

Before the election, candidates tried to meet potential voters and get
their name into circulation. At this time, however, they seldom made
formal speeches or directly solicited votes. Instead, they might make
their views known through letters to the local newspaper or rely on
friends and allies to celebrate their patriotic virtues and sterling
leadership qualities. At least until the second decade of the nineteenth
century, "electioneering," as it was called, was disdained. Candidates
did, however, have other ways of persuading their potential
constituents. Although officially prohibited, the custom of "treating,"
especially prevalent in the South, meant that in the days prior to the
election candidates might invite voters to picnics featuring generous
servings of barbecue, washed down by copious amounts of liquor. Prior to
the 1758 election for the Virginia House of Burgesses, George Washington
reportedly served over 160 gallons of rum punch, wine, beer, and other
spirits to potential voters. Perhaps not surprisingly, the young
Washington triumphed over his opponent.

Whenever they occurred, elections did not necessarily take place over the
course of a single day. The sheriff, or other local election official,
could if he so wished either extend or shorten the amount of time in
which the polls were open. If, for example, excessive rains and flooding
made it difficult for voters from an outlying area to reach the polling
site, the clerk might keep the poll open for two-to-three days---or in
some cases, even a week, so that anyone who wanted to vote might do so.
A corrupt official, on the other hand, might choose to prematurely close
the polls to prevent certain voters from reaching the site in time.

Elections were communal affairs, sometimes with celebratory overtones,
sometimes with more ominous overtones. Elections could be held at almost
any public venue---from a town hall to a courthouse to a church or
tavern. Arriving at the site, electors often confronted a "tumultuous
assemblage of men," as Richard Henry Lee put it, where people milled
about---talking, arguing, and sometimes, drinking. In the North, where
elections were more sober affairs, women and children might be present,
bringing with them "election cakes," baked especially for the occasion.

Actually casting the ballot was a kind of public performance. By 1800,
most states, with the exception of Virginia and Kentucky, had moved from
oral voting (*viva voce*) to the secret, written ballot. Nonetheless,
electors often found themselves at the center of public attention. When
they cast their ballots, voters moved one-by-one to the front of a line,
under the close scrutiny of other members of the community. They
sometimes had to mount a number of steps to reach an elevated dais.
There they would place their folded ballot in a slot in a wooden ballot
box. Many individuals, including their creditors, patrons, or other
powerful individuals, looked on as they did so.

During the colonial period, most colonies, like Great Britain, had
required that electors possess property---typically either a fifty-acre
freehold or land worth fifty shillings. Although voting qualifications
varied from state-to-state, by 1800 a majority of states had lowered, or
even dropped, property requirements for voting. Throughout the country,
perhaps 80% of all adult white males were eligible to vote. In New
Jersey from 1776 to 1807, women were actually allowed to vote on the
same terms as men. Only three states---Virginia, South Carolina, and
Georgia---explicitly confined the vote to white males. There were no
voter registration rolls. Electors simply declared that they had met the
suffrage requirements for that state. If someone doubted the voter's
eligibility, they would declare their objections to the officials. The
individual's ballot would be set aside, for further investigation.
Though not overt, then, the pressure to vote for a certain candidate was
often unmistakable.

As party hostilities between the Federalists and Democratic-Republicans 
intensified, tensions between participants sometimes erupted into public 
violence---what was called an "election riot." It was not uncommon for 
partisans on both sides to march in formation to the polling site, dressed in 
their militia uniforms. Bearing guns or sticks, their intention was not only to 
display party solidarity but to intimidate voters holding opposing views. In 
1793, the House Committee of Elections heard testimony about a disputed 
election in which one candidate's supporters threatened "to beat any person who 
voted for \[their opponent\]"---who subsequently lost. Although no one 
challenged the veracity of the accusation, the House rejected the aggrieved 
candidate's petition. "Why," said one Congressman, "should there be such a 
noise about this election in particular, when others were just as bad, or a 
great deal worse\[?\]"

There was, then, no uniform or overt march toward democracy in the early
United States. The diversity in electoral practices among the states
meant that the country remained an experiment in republican government.
Within each state, various factions battled with one another to try and
work out what its own citizens meant by the march toward *democracy*.
